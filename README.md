This is a subset of computer vision practical and theoretical course prepared by Dr. ALi Mayya. 
The codes correspond to 11 lectures but are put in one directory so if you want to run each lecture separately, I uploaded the .rar files containing separate lectures. 
Feel free to contact me: ali.mayya@tishreen.edu.sy, a.mayya1988@gmail.com. 
Note: these lectures and codes are part of my computer vison course at Al Manara University, Syria.
IF you use codes or lectures, please cite me as: Mayya, A, "Computer vision course", Al Manara University, 2024.
